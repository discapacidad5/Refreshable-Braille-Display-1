# Refreshable-Braille-Display
Created Screen Braille Display with SMA modules connected to PC or Phone using Arduino as embedded micro controller to send text from screen as Braille codes to SMA modules.

# Platform Specification:
• Embedded Micro Controller : Arduino (preferably)
• USB Interface
• Bluetooth: BLE 4.0.
• Communication Protocol: UART

# Requirements: 
The Device should incorporate following features:
    Hardware:
    1. The Hardware Includes a main Controller with interfaces to interact with other peripherals,
    Bluetooth, USB converter (FTDI) and Power Supply. 
    2. Navigation Keys to scroll through the lines. 
    3. A casing/enclosure to fit the modules and hardware to give a product appearance.

    Software:
    1. Braille interface library implementing all the commands specified in the format document. 
    2. Control flow which handles various devices connected to the system. 
    3. Drivers for both PC and Smartphone 4. Navigation key handling 5. The system should have below specified modes:
        a. PC - NVDA
            i. USB mode 
            ii. BLE mode 
        b. Smartphone – Brailleback
            i. USB mode ii. BLE mode

# Deliverables:
• The Final deliverables will be a 20 Cell Passive braille display prototype with connectivity to PC and Smartphone through USB and Bluetooth mounted in a complete enclosure.
• The prototype would undergo a trail with a Visually Impaired user and the feedback to be incorporated before the final Demonstration.
• Documentation of the system developed
• Complete Source code uploaded to the repository specified
